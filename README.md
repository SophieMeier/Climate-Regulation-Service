# CLIMATE REGULATION INDICATOR - EXAMPLE OF GERMANY

Literature:
Syrbe et al. (2022): Vorschlag für einen Klimaregulationsindikator [Suggestion for a climate regulation indicator]. Naturschutz und Landschaftsplanung.

Model based on: "Climate Cooling Assessment (CCA) von Zardo, L., Geneletti, D., Pérez-Soba, M. und van Eupen, M. (2017): 
Estimating the cooling capacity of green infrastructures to support urban planning. In: Ecosystem Services (26), 225-235."


Python script to calculate the cooling capacity of cities for the atlantic zone (mediterranean zone and continental zone is possible after adapting the model according to values of Zardo et al. (2017). The case study used in the original work (Syrbe et al. 2022) are German cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants within the functional urban areas (Urban Atlas, Copernicus).
